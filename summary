For the first part of the project, we want to provide a general 
understanding of the problem, showing its main characteristics 
and in which extends it is spread.

In order to do this, we've come up with a data set with all the 
elections during the last 20 years occurred in Europe. 

On Wikipedia, we found information on every party that took place
in every elections and we gave it a weight according to whether
it was:

    left-wing populism:      -2
    left-wing to far-left: -1.5
    left-wing:               -1
    centre-left:           -0.5
    centre:                   0
    centre-right:           0.5
    right:                    1
    right-wing to far-right:1.5
    right-wing populism:      2
    
We created an index multuplying these weights for the number of votes
in percentage that each party received in each elections. 

With this index, we were able to build a first picture of the
general trend of every country on a set of information that spans
along a range of 20 years. We were then able to compare this general 
trend with the outcome of the last elections, in order to catch any
correlation between the general political position of the country and
a rise in populism.
